I love ligitimate suffering, and my opportunity for purposeful suffering is when I 
learn coding and IT and wake up my brain!

I concentrate by wide eyes and intense look on my focus as I bring laser like focus
just like I did in Dr. Amoo's class and all things I did passionately!!!

Great now that you are using intensity of foucs for coding, git and learning IT now
your are bound to grow then you'll automatically success! Remember the slightest bit
of doubt and just going through the motion is killing you. Especially if you have
slight degree of ADHD! The only way to counter it is by how you did it in Dr. Amoo's 
class and all the other time I brough passion, physicality, will, and then the time 
I put in paid off. Then it will all began to click and work and I find flow then I am 
trusting the process and make it work for me which result in sucess!

Always be on your edge, intensily, and passionately learn. As you engage with your eyes,
mind, body, and spirit then you can overcome your ADD. Then you'll see more flashes 
of your brilliance until it shines bright with continues sharpening the sord.
